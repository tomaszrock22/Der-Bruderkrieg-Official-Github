  germangame.7.d:0 "Goering arrived safely in Pomerania. He met with the OKW, and in an emergency session, they agreed to march on Berlin. With the army in the city, most ceased the riots. Goering increased wages to smooth the operation. The diehard Spartacists, well, died a hard death. The revolution was broken by Goering’s fist. After the battle, Goering was approached by von Mackensen. Goering congratulated the man, who responded with his incessant demand; the SA needs to go. Goering rolled his eyes, promised to think about it. Mackensen replied that he should think quickly, lest this happen again. For now, though, the Reichsmarshall returns to his capital."

Luxemburg emerged from the Schwarzwald to address the workers, and shortly news came that Pieck was returning from British exile. Prussia, now a socialist supoerpower, is at a crossroads"

 germany.5433.t:0 "Containing the Militias Event Body"
 germany.5433.d:0 " The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n The second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to really it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other. \n Waiting will only anger both, so we must destroy one to appease the other. Herr Reichsmarshall, who shall we destroy?"
 germany.5433.a:0 "Rohm is too radical, we can't anger the Wehrmacht. "
