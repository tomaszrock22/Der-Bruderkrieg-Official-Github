FRENCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of Napoleon III in 1873, Napoleon IV in 1898, Napoleon V in 1926, Napoleon VI took over and promulgated a constitution, more liberal than the previous. Riding high on support gained from this, he has ruled justly and fostered a strong emigre community and a sense of nationalism in the people. After the German Revolution of 1930, France annexed the Rhineland, and the combination of these two factors has made Napoleon VI highly popular. As France gears up for war with the fascists, the Empire of Austria, and the British, Napoleon VI serves as a rallying point for Frenchmen everywhere. Vive la France!"
