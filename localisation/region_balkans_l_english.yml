###Greece
GRE_greek_revanchism:0 "Greek Revanchism"
GRE_greek_revanchism_desc:0 "Greece was once the greatest of civilizations in the world. It was a home of art and sciences and the cradle of civilization. It was once owned by Rome, then the Byzantines, then the Ottomans and finally gained independence in 1829 with the conclusion of its independence war. It watched its northern neighbours get liberated in 1878 by the Russian Bear, and together they successfully kicked the Ottomans out of the Balkans. Greece, however, was far from its old form. It was limited to half of its greatest size by the traitorous Bulgarians, and still the Ottomans owned the Western Coast. In 1899, under George the 1st, the Greeks declared war on the Bulgarians to regain Thessaloniki. Immediately, the Russians and Austrians intervened and held the Conference of Budapest, and each side was invited to attend. Austria hoped to broker a peace deal in favor of the Greek Monarchy while the Russians hoped to punish Greece for hurting Bulgaria, who was in their sphere of influence. In the end, both sides agreed that Greece should have to pay economic concessions to Bulgaria for 20 years for their aggression threatening to destroy the Balkan concert, though Austria secretly supported Greece with economic benefits to counter the Russians.\nIn the Europa Krieg, Greece made numerous attempts to retake their rightful land, but was rejected by the superior First Brother's Coalition. Despite gaining Northern Epirus, Greece still vows to reconquer Thrace, siege Istanbul and Izmir, and bring back Byznatium once more."

GRE_healing_economy_desc:0 "Debts to the Bulgars and the strain of the Europa Krieg destroyed Greece's already fragile economy. With a combination of economic reforms, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos has managed the bring Greece out of the recession. He has boosted exports of goods like tobacco, olive oil, and raisins, which was greatly bettered Greece's situation. But unemployment is still high, as is debt. It remains whether to be seen if Venizelos can bring Greece out of the Recession and back to economic greatness."

 GRE_shattered_military:0 "Shattered Military"
 GRE_shattered_military_desc:0 "When the Europakrieg rolled around, Greece saw another opportunity and with Austrian pressure joined the Congress of Vienna. Together, they jointly occupied Albania and Greece attacked Bulgaria, who had recently joined the side of the Russians. The Ottomans, who had also joined the Austrians, reluctantly accepted to fight with the Greeks, but the two refused to cooperate more than necessary, which upset the Austrians.\nThe Greeks are able to secure Plovdiv, but the Ottomans are unable to advance too much into Bulgaria without much Greek support on their front. Alexandroupolis was also surrounded by Greek forces in June of 1915, a 3 day battle for the city followed, ending in a Greek victory. Following this, Greece announced it would be renaming Plovdiv to Phillipopolis, the ancient Greek name for Plovdiv. But, Russian forces mobilize and enter Bulgaria, and with Serbians, Bulgarians and Russians fighting in Bulgaria, the Greeks are pushed back to Alexandroupolis.\nThe next battle would be one to remember. At the 2nd Battle of Alexandrouplis, the Greeks were obliterated by the opposing forces. It would be a night to never forget, with tens of thousands dead. The Greek Military still hasn't recovered from the stunning defeat.\nAfter that came loss after loss, till Greece eventually pulled out of the war having gained nothing."

The monarchy under King George the 2nd was officially in ruins.\nEnter Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Nationalist and Democratic Leader who launches a coup against the monarchy. He and General Ioannas Metaxas, one of the other leaders of the armed forces, overthrow the monarchy. The king to an unknown other country. He till this day is yet to be found, though many people expect he is hiding in the mountains of Austria.\nThe King's secret supporters, however, still lurk in the shadows. They seek revenge for overthrowing who they believe to be the next ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Each day, they plot to bring the king back from exile and hand him back his throne."
